9. Palindrome Number
   <br>
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 
<br>
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
<br>
Output: true
<br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
<br>

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
<br>
Output: false
<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
<br>
Example 3:
<br>
Input: x = 10
<br>
Output: false
<br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:
<br>

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
